# Pantsu Run
As a final project in our first semester, we had to programm a minigame using javascript and p5.js. <br> <br>
So I made a jump and run in which the protagonist (a schoolgirl) lost all her clothes, so she runs around school to collect pantys. I know it does not make alot of sense, but I still think it's quite funny. <br><br>
!!Altert: there is gonna be some cringy and annoying background music!
