# Bongo Cat
One year ago our coding professor showed us a interactive bongocat(from  the popular bongocat meme) that he made using only js and p5.js,
to show our first semester what p5 is able to do. But I was thinking: "I can make a better bongocat then him" and so I did. <br> <br>

Controls: A and D is controlling the paws<br> W makes the cat talk <br> 1,2,3,Ö,Ä,N,M makes the rest move <br>
## just try it out it's annoying, kinda trippy and fun!
